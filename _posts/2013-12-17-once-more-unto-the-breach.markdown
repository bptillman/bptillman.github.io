So I decided to start up the whole blogging thing again.

This time the blog is run on the [Ghost](http://ghost.org) blogging platform in [Azure](http://windowsazure.com). I've tried [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) before and it's just gotten too bloated and nowhere near as light and responsive as it used to be (without the help of caching and plugins), which is something Ghost seems to excel at.

So now what will I be talking about on here...who knows. The short: life; the long: development work I do at work and home, music I enjoy listening to, beer I drink and make, games, photography, and plenty else.

So sit down, relax, and hold onto your butts.
